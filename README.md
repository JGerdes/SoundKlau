# SoundKlau
Download any track directly from SoundCloud.

SoundKlau adds an extra button to a track's SoundCloud page to download it. Even to those, you normally can't download!


**The awesome part**: 

SoundKlau also adds availabe information right into the ID3-tags of the mp3 file! The artist's name, title of the track, genre (if available), release date and even the cover displayed on the SoundCloud page!

### Installation
Download the [latest version of the extension](https://github.com/JGerdes/SoundKlau/raw/master/build/soundklau.crx). Open `chrome://extensions/` in Chrome and drag'n'drop the `soundklau.crx` file there. Now you are ready to go!

**Remember**: If you like the tracks of an artist, support him/her by buying their music! _This extension is meant to be used for unreleased tracks or mixsets!_
